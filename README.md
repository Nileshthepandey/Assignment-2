Hello Sir,
In this repo i have uploaded two python scripts which are my assignment

In task 1, there is a code to check if the number is even or odd.
In task 2, there is a code to find the sum from 1 to 50.
           In this task, i was confused that task demands sum from 1 to 50 or it is asking for a desired number between 1 to 50.
           So, i wrote two codes in it.
